# CodingChallenge
A coding challenge for Illumio

I turned in what I was done with after 2 hours, the code isn't fully refactored. There is more than likely a linear time complexity solution I skipped over.

***** Implementation *****
Firewall reads the CSV file by individual line
FirewallRule takes in the given parameters from the assignment page and Ip and Port edit those parameters as necessary


***** Testing *****
I used valid packets on the first test case and then slightly changed them to be invalid on the second test case. Junit was used to test.

***** Team *****
I'm interested in the data team the most, but have experience with the platform and api development at my current company
